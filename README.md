# Sorting Algorithms in Python

This repository contains Python implementations of various sorting algorithms. Each algorithm is interactive, allowing the user to input a list they want to sort and displaying the steps of the sorting process.

## Merge Sort

Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively splits a list into smaller sublists, sorts them, and then merges the sorted sublists.

- To run the Merge Sort algorithm, use `MergeSort.py`.

## Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.

- To run the Insertion Sort algorithm, use `InsertionSort`.

## Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

- To run the Bubble Sort algorithm, use `BubbleSort.py`.

## Selection Sort

Selection Sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm that divides the list into two parts: the left part is sorted, and the right part is unsorted. It repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted part and moves it to the sorted part.

- To run the Selection Sort algorithm, use `SelectionSort.py`.

## Quick Sort

Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a pivot element and partitions the array into two subarrays: elements less than the pivot and elements greater than the pivot. It then recursively sorts the subarrays.

- To run the Quick Sort algorithm, use `QuickSort.py`.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the algorithm of your choice.
3. Run the Python script.
4. Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces when prompted.
5. Observe the step-by-step sorting process.

Feel free to use and modify these sorting algorithms for your own projects!
